## Description
Milesnap is a web application that lets users celebrate and showcase their milestones through videos. Create and share a video highlighting your achievements with ease!

## Feedback
> While participating in the hackathon, I successfully leveraged Supabase authentication using GitHub. The integration process was remarkably straightforward.

> That being said, I wasn't able to achieve the envisioned outcome due to constraints in time and my current expertise.

> In hindsight, my chosen approach wasn't optimal. I now realize that a more effective solution would have been to commence with milestones displayed directly on a canvas. Transitioning from that to video likely would have been a smoother process.

> Guess it's a reminder not to be too rigid in my approach!

> Nonetheless, stepping outside of my comfort zone was a rewarding experience. Moving away from the usual CRUD apps, this project opened my eyes to new perspectives and possibilities I hadn't previously considered.

> Looking forward to presenting a refined, more streamlined version in the near future. Stay tuned! ðŸ‘€
